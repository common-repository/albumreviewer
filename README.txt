== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q: Is Album Reviewer compatible with my theme? =

A: The free version allows up to 5 active Album Reviews. We will be releasing a premium version soon. Sign up via the settings menu to get notified.

= Q: Can I upload full size album spreads? =

= Q: Can I upload individual pages (single page leafs)? =

A: The premium version includes support for individual pages.

= Q: What is included in the premium version? =
